<h1>Welcome to Meeting Security Policy</h1>
<p></p>
<p>I'm thrilled about meeting and the potential collaboration ahead. However, as I'm not yet familiar with everyone I meet, I've implemented a meeting security policy. This policy aims to ensure a safe and secure environment for both parties involved.</p>

<h2>Meeting Security Policy Details:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>As part of this policy, there is a nominal damage fee that will be collected prior to our meeting. This fee acts as a precautionary measure to cover any unforeseen damages that may occur during our interaction.</li>
  <li>I want to emphasize that this policy is not a reflection of mistrust, but rather a standard practice to safeguard everyone's interests.</li>
  <li>If no damages occur during our meeting, rest assured that the fee will be promptly refunded to you. To facilitate the refund process, I will initiate it via Cash App, ensuring a seamless and efficient transaction.</li>
</ul>
